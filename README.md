# Pseudocode.tex

This is a TeX package for typesetting pseudocode. It is quite bare at the moment, because the author didn't need too many features at the moment of writing it.

## Dependencies

* OPmac - this package will eventually work with captions provided by OPmac. For now this dependency can be removed.

## Future plans

* Positioning (centering) the output.
* Framing the output.
* Captions:
  * which will work with OPmac captions.
  * Referable captions by line number.
* Small caps font for line numbering.
* Wrapping statements with braces is quite uncomfortable.
* Comments.
* Improving the source code as I learn more about TeX.
* Documentation.
